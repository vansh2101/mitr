## Challenges we ran into üëÄ
The most challenging part was to create a dataset and finetune our ai model to generate MERN code blocks specific to the given requirement.s 


## Setup
1) Clone the git repository into your local machine
2) `cd` to the `backend` folder
3) Create your `OPENAI_API_KEY` on Open AI platform
4) Add this to `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY= <your key>`
5) Now, run `npm i`
6) Then, `cd` to the `frontend` folder
7) Create your project on firebase platform
8) Create `firebaseConfig.js` file in `src/scripts` folder
9) run `npm i`
10) Finally, run `npm start` in `frontend` folder anf `node app.js` in `backend` folder
